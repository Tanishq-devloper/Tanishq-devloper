- #Dashboard Layout

Project Title:

 Dashboard Layout


Project Description:

 It is like a edtech website layout which contains different tasks and projects for the student and his/her analysis based on that.
 I have used html ,css and javascript to make this layout.


Inspiration to make this project:

This framework is specifically designed for C3 Experiential Learning Private Limited for web devlopment internship.


Description of the Technologies Used:

a)HTML:
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
b)CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
c)Javascript:
avaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.


Description of libraries used to make framework

1)SVG Chart Library:

An SVG chart library.

So far this has a pie chart.

This is designed to be a simple consumable pie chart, as well as a simple example of an elm package.

The interface is kept intentionally simple, and I would like to maintain this simplicity.

2)ChartJS:

Chart.js is an open source JavaScript library on Github that allows you to draw different types of charts by using the HTML5 canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you have to include a polyfill to support older browsers.
